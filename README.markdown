Applying for a position at [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com), I wrote a pair of programs using PHP and TwiML to help my application stand out.

The first can be dialed at 650-2-POEM-62 and allows the caller to hear me read a poem, record a poem of their own, or connect directly to my cell phone.

After thinking through the rules of [dreidel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreidel) in an entirely different way, one sufficient to explain them in plain English to someone who requires clear instructions for every game event, I had to figure out how to turn those conceptual directions into something a computer could interpret to drive the gameplay.

Unlike the first program, built by modifying Twilio's quick-start code, with my second program I started from scratch and encountered obstacles for which there were no ready solutions. With only [php.net](http://www.php.net) and Google searches for help, and only one PHP document under my belt, it was slow going at first.

A day or so of coding later, and I had the call-in game playing without issue. After a lot of trial and error, I felt the dancing-around-the-room-by-yourself joy of building something that works as intended.
